# Task 1: 
- Describe in your own words (max 300 words) the model and model parameters: How do the populations of the three species change in the model? What do the parameters represent? 
- During the first model, the population starts with 1 plant, and 0.1 hares and lynxes. All these three populations grow and decay following a sinusoidal curve within a period of 70 months.

- For the three cases the parameters represent the following:
a1 = Growth rate of hares
a2 = Growth rate of lynxes
b1 = Predation rate of hares on plants
b2 = Predation rate of lynxes on hares
d1 = Death rate of hares
d2 = Death rate of lynxes
