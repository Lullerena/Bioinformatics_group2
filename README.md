# Task 1: 
- Describe in your own words (max 300 words) the model and model parameters: How do the populations of the three species change in the model? What do the parameters represent?
- For the three cases the parameters represent the following:
a1 = Growth rate of hares
a2 = Growth rate of lynxes
b1 = Predation rate of hares on plants
b2 = Predation rate of lynxes on hares
d1 = Death rate of hares
d2 = Death rate of lynxes

### Model 1
- During the first model, the population starts with 1 plant, and 0.1 hares and lynxes. All these three populations grow and decay following a sinusoidal curve within a period of 70 months.

### Model 2
- During the second model, the population starts with 1 plant, and 0.1 hares and 1 lynxes. The plant and hares populations oscillate regularly and follow a sinusoidal curve between 0.04 and 0.8 for plant population size and between 0.09 and 0.68 for hare population size. However the lynxes population will dramatically decrese to 0 at about 11.8/12 months.

### Model 3
- During the third model, the population starts with 1 plant, and 0.1 hares and 8 lynxes. The model displays a chaotic behaviour for all populations. The lynx population peaks twice, once around 40 months and the second time around 180 months.
